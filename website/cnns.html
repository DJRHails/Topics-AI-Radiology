					<h2>What is a CNN?</h2>
					<p>
					A CNN is a neural network which classifies images by using kernel convolutions in the hidden layer.
					</p>
					<h3>Quick introduction to neural networks</h3>
					<blockquote cite="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=38295">
						A neural network is a system made up of a number of simple, highly interconnected processing elements which process information by their dynamic state response to external inputs.
						<sup><a href="#foot-1">1</a></sup>
					</blockquote>
					<p>
					Neural nets are usually made up of a series of layers, each of which contains a selection of <i>'nodes'</i> which create an <i>'activation function'</i>.	
					<ul>
						There are typically 3 <i>'types'</i> of layers:
						<li>Input</li>
						<li>Hidden Layers</li>
						<li>Output</li>
					</ul>
					Data (patterns) enter the network via the input layer, are passed through one or more hidden layers and the result is given in the output layer.

					Neural nets enable computers to learn to perform some task by analysing training samples. Often this is done using data which has been labelled so corrections in the model can be made. This is called supervised learning.
					</p>
					<h3>Convolutions</h3>
					<blockquote>
						A convolution is a mathematical operation on two functions to produce a third function which is seen as a modification of one of the first functions, giving the integral of the pointwise multiplication of the two functions as a function of the amount that one of the original functions is translated.
						<sup><a href="#foot-2">2</a></sup></blockquote>
					<p>
					Convolution is defined as:
					$$ (f * g )(t) = \int_{0}^{t} f(\tau)\, g(t - \tau)\, d\tau\ \mathrm{for} \ \ f, g : [0, \infty) \to \mathbb{R} $$
					where \( (f * g )(t) \) represents the convolution of \(f\) on \(g\). For discrete functions this is analogous to:
					$$ (f * g)[n]\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \sum_{m=-\infty}^\infty f[m]\, g[n - m] $$
					</p>
					<h3>CNN</h3>
					<p>So, putting those together, a CNN will try to find features in a new image by passing performing a convolution of the feature matrix over the image. This will result in a new map of where in the image the feature is found.</p>
					<p>Each layer will use various nodes, which are really feature maps, from the previous layer to compute more complex features.</p>

					<p>Typically, in the hidden layers, there are 3 types of layers - <b>convolutional layers</b>, <b>pooling layers</b>, and <b>activation layers</b>.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Convolutional Layers - this is where the convolutions happen.</li>
						<li>Pooling layers - used to take large images and make them smaller while preserving the most important information.</li>
						<li>Activation layers - a layer which performs an activation process to ensure the feature does not get lost at deeper layers. Often this is ReLU (Rectified Linear Units), which keeps positive values unchanged and negatives are set to 0.
							<sup>
								<a href="#foot-3">3</a>
							</sup>

						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>One final type of layer is a fully connected layer. A CNN will have at least one of these at the end and these are responsible for converting the output of the convolution, pooling and activation layers into votes for a particular class.</p>

					<h2>Inside a CNN</h2>
					<article>
						<p>
						As mentioned above, a CNN consists of an input layer, a series of hidden layers, one or more fully connected layers and an output layer.
						Below we can see that a CNN will have more than one of each of the hidden layers, however they may not always be in a stack of convolution, ReLU, pooling. This is because there are often times when you wish to perform two convolutions without changing the size of the image.
						</p>

						<p>The output of the CNN is a set of probabilities of the input being classified as each class. The highest value is taken and it is said that the CNN is, in this example, 92% sure it is a <b>X</b>.</p>

					<h2>Training</h2>
					<p>
					We have explained how a CNN will classify an image, however how does it know what features to look for and what the weights should be for each output.
					<br/>
					We need to <b>train</b> the network, and this is done using labelled data and <b>backpropagation</b>.
					</p>
					<h3>Backpropagation</h3>
					<p>
					To train the CNN, we first start with an untrained CNN, where every pixel in all features and every weight in the fully connected layers are set to random values.
					<br/>Next, each image is fed in one by one and the error between the CNN output and the label is calculated. The lower this error the better at classifying that particular image our CNN is. The features and the weights are adjusted up or down according to the amount of error and the weights and features which cause a lower error are kept.
					</p>
					<p>As more and more images are fed in, the better the CNN becomes at classification and individual differences in images of the same class are quickly forgotten and features which are prevelant throughout are kept.</p>
					
					<p>Performing the actual backpropagation for features requires calculating partial derivatives of the error with the last convolutional layer to calculate the features and then passing back another partial derivative to the next layer.</p>

					<h2>Using CNN's for multiple object classification</h2>
					<p>
					When the classes are non-linearly separable, a kernel is used.
					A kernel is a mathematical function that transforms a low-dimensional input space into a high-dimensional space, allowing classes to become linearly separable.
					Once the input data has been transformed, the SVM can be trained in the same way as linearly-separable classes.<sup>1</sup>
					<br>
					Kernels often used for MRI brain tumour classification include <sup>2</sub>:
					<ul>
					</ul>
					The choice of kernel is not obvious, and so determining the optimal hyper-plane involves testing with different kernels.

					<h2>Impact on medical image analysis</h2>
					<p>
					One images have been pre-processed, the next step is to extract numerical features.
					The choice of numerical features are important as they will determine the success of any machine learning model.
					<ul> Features can be grouped into:
						<li>Grey-scale features: these include mean, variance, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis</li>
						<li>Texture-features: these include entropy, dissimilarity, inverse, energy, contrast and IDM </li>
						<li>Symmetric feature: the exterior symmetry </li>
					</ul>
					Once features are obtained, PCA (Principle Component Analysis) can reduce the number of features needed.
					This is useful because excessive features increases memory use and computation time.<sup>4</sup>
