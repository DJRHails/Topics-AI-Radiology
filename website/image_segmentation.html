          <h1>Image Segmentation</h1>
          <p>Fundamental components of MRI is the diagnosis, delineation and separation of tumor tissues, such as active cells, neurotic core and edema from the normal brain tissues. Classification and Segmentation are interlinked because segmentation implies a classification. Before any therapy, it's crucial to segment the tumor in order to protect healthy tissues while damaging and destroying tumor cells during the therapy.  </p>

					<h1 id="summary">Manual</h1>
          <p>The completely manual method for segmentation would be to draw the desired borders directly onto the raw image. This would take too much time and be prone to errors, especially due to fatigue. Manual segmentation requires the radiologist to use the visual and spatial information presented by the MRI images along with anatomical and physiological knowledge gained through training and experience. Procedure involves the radiologist going through multiple slices of images slice by slice, diagnosing the tumor and manually drawing the tumor regions carefully.</p>

              <div class="content">
                <p>Apart from being a time consuming task, manual segmentation is also radiologist dependent and segmentation results are subject to large intra (variability between repeated administrations of segmentation by a single rater) and inter rater variability (variability between repeated administrations of segmentation by different raters)<a id="foot-3-ref" href="#foot-3" class="smooth-scroll"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>
                <h4>Intraoperator Repeat Results:</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>95%</li>

                </ul>
                <p>Given the vital nature of accuracy in this scenario it's a suprising that the variation is so high, and suggests that automated solutions will probably be far more consistent.</p>

          <p>Semi-Automatic methods require interaction of the user for three main purposes:

              <li>Feedback response and evaluation - Evaluate the results and modify or repeat the process if not satisfied.</li>

                <p>The simplest method of image segmentation that directly dicides the image gray scale information processing based on the gray value of different targets. Threshold segmentation can be divided into a local threshold method and global threshold method. The most commond threshold algorithm is the "largest interclass variance method" which selects a globally optimal threshold by maximising the variance between classes.</p>
                <p>The global threshold method divides the image into two regions of the targt and the background by a single threshold.<a id="foot-5-ref" href="#foot-5" class="smooth-scroll"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>
                <p>The local threshold method needs to select multiple segmentation thresholds and divide the image into multiple regions and backgrounds.</p>
                <h4>Advantages</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>Calculation is simple</li>
                  <li>Operation speed is fast</li>
                  <li>In particular, when the target and the background have high contrast, the segmentation effect is good</li>

                <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                <ul>

                  <li>Only takes into account the gray information of the image without considering the spatial information</li>
                  <li>Sensitive to noise and grayscale unevenness</li>

                <p>The image is divided into "object" and "background" segments using a graph cut approach. A graph is formed by connecting all pairs of neighbouring image pixels (voxels) by weighted edges. Certain voxels have to be identifed providing necessary clues about image content. Objective is the cheapest way to cut the edges in the graph so that the object seeds are completely separated from the background seeds. This is a known issue</p>

                <p>Place a mark on the image to indicate regions desired as foreground and regions as background. First marks are done on forground and then again on the background. This gives a reasonable first pass on the segmentation but if the intensity values are too similar then a good segmentation can't be achieved</p>

          <p>Automatic segmentation of gliomas is challenging as tumor bearing MRI data is 3D data where tumor shape, size and location that can vary from patient to patient. Tumor boundaires are often unclear and irregular with discontnuities posing very hard challenges for edge-based methods.Automatic tumor segmentation has the potential to decrease time between diagnostic tests and treatment by providing an efficient and standardized report of tumor location in a fraction of the time it would take a radiologist to do so.</p>
