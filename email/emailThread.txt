Dear all,

If you want to discuss your Topics projects, can I please ask you to come on Friday this week at 13:00 to my office 377.

I'm afraid due to the strike this is the only available time slot. If you can't make it at that time, feel free to send me an progress report via email, I will send back feedback on Friday.

Please confirm whether you will be joining the meeting on Friday.

Best wishes

Ben

Hi Tiger,

This looks all very good, and I think you covered enough aspects to make this into a nice story. Make sure to work out the links between different parts, for example, visually on the website (maybe some sort of flow diagram).

Best wishes

Hi Ben, 

I have attached the progress report as well as a breakdown of the content we have so far.

Hi Tiger,
 
Would you mind sending me a brief progress report, half a page, describing what you've been doing in terms of research, and what your plan is for the next weeks. I will then provide feedback either in a meeting or via email.

Best wishes

Hi Ben,

The Topics slides specify that we should contact you in the 5th week to organise an optional Progress meeting where we discuss how the group is getting on with regards to the research quantity and quality. 

My group has communicated to me most of their research in our latest meeting so I'll relay this to you to ensure that we're on the right track. 

When would be convenient for you?

Regards

Tiger

Thanks, Tiger. That sounds very good, and is a very suitable topic.
 
Just a note, that currently CNNs are mostly used to detect, localise and segment brain tumours for quantitative analysis, rather than making the actual diagnosis. But you can explore this as part of your research.
 
Best, Ben

Hi Ben,
 
We have had a group meeting today and discussed that we would like to make our website and presentation on the sub-topic of Technology in AI and radiology, looking at the sub-sub-topic: Diagnosis of brain tumors using MRI imagery.
 
we intend to look at several techniques in which neural nets are used to diagnose brain tumors, comparing them to traditional methods that doctors use.
 
Is this suitable and is the topic still free?
 
Many thanks
 
Tiger

Dear all,
 
I understand you are the group leaders of the four groups assigned to the topic Medical Image Computing.
 
Could we please meet tomorrow, Friday Jan 26th, at 16:00 in my office 377? This is to discuss your first steps for your projects. It should be fine if only the group leaders attend, but if you want you can bring one additional member of your group (for more there is no space in my office, I'm afraid).
 
Let me know in case you cannot make the meeting tomorrow.
 
Best wishes
Ben
